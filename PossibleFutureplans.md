# Introduction #

Future development plans


# Details #

I've generally liked to keep my plans modest for now.  At the moment the editor, is very crude and potentially has much work for furthered development.  Although I've managed to include up until now on branch wver1.1:
**Voronoi (fortune algorithm)** Simplex noise generator
**Perlin noise generator**

Both Simplex and Voronoi generators have embedded fbm for terrain fractal
generation.

I'd potentially like to include:
**Diamond square** Midpoint algorithm,
**Musgrave, and others** Erosion simulators
**User defined height and gradient color ramps for texturing** Data exporting
**Seamless terrain tiling**

Adding to much of these I may include random seeding and
increasing speed of renderings likely with pre compiled sample data
sets alongside user customization in building seed libraries.
