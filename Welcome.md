Ogre3d terrain editor welcome page

# Introduction #

Currently working on this project solo for now.  I am presently exploring Ogre3D middleware in terms of application for terrain generation.

# Details #

This program at the moment includes:
  * Advanced perlin noise field generators with user control features
  * Blend noise heightmap algorithms.  Add, Difference, Multiply, and Divide.
  * Simple Proportional smooth falloff terrain height adjustments
  * Adapted from intermediate Ogre3d tutorials, or in other words,
> if you can follow the intermediate tutorial sets on the Ogre3d wiki, you'll likely have a good foundation.
