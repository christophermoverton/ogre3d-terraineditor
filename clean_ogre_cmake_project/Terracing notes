Terracing algorithm 

Simpler one that I can think of, involves bounding volumes for vertex selection.  

We'd use a step subdivision based upon the difference from max min heights.

Once obtaining this subdivision, 

we can use a bounding volume for vertex selections in a certain range.  Once having these vertices all gathered within a given range we floor these to the particular heightband of the terrace elevation.  

This is like the process of terracing to create a layered cake.  

By using bounding volumes and intersection testing we ensure that we select the right vertices for the right range, automatically this countours along the terracing elevation ranges by intersection testing.
