Assuming you have installed Ogre locally on your system alongside CEGUI and the FFTW libraries, you'll need to copy these cmake files into 
your local ogre cmake directory.  You can do this on Ubuntu from terminal by going to this directory, and using the following commands:

sudo cp CompareVersionStrings.cmake DetermineVersion.cmake FindCEGUI.cmake FindCEGUIOGRE.cmake FindFFTW.cmake FindPackageHandleAdvancedArgs.cmake HandleLibraryTypes.cmake /usr/local/lib/OGRE/cmake/
